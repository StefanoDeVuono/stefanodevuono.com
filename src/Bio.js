    I'm a San Francisco-based web developer. I've often straddled the line between art and technology, design and code. I wrote my first university essay on emacs on my new Linux install. I ran a dance company and taught myself JavaScript to make a more interactive website. I've dabbled in design (print and UX). I've worked on back-ends and front-ends. I worked as a web (and sometimes embedded hardware) developer a digital art startup, where I patented a digital image security system I designed. I currently consult, work on digital art projects and volunteer.
