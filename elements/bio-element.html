    <p>I like a challenge. I learned Quark, Photoshop and Illustrator in French while learning French. I wrote my first university essay on emacs on my new Linux install. I left school to found a small dance company and realizing that no one would do it for me, I taught myself CSS and HTML. I coded everything by hand. I eventually learned enough JavaScript and AJAX to implement Stuart Rackhams's DOM Popup Kit, based on prototype. I even sent him a few corrections. Over the past few years I've gotten more and more into PHP and jQuery to create custom WordPress templates all while learning HTML5 and CSS3. I care about design, use and code. I'm that guy: the stylish nerd who loves learning and trying new things.</p>
