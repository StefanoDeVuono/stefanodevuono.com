### Stefano De Vuono

My personal website, based on [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/).

I use:

  - [Material Design](https://material-ui-next.com/) for layout.
  - [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios/) for requests.
  - And [tumblr](https://tumblr.com) for the blog portion

For hosting I use [surge](https://surge.sh/), which is great for hosting one page apps.

I'm a San Francisco-based software engineer.
