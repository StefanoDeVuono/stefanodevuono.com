My personal website, based on [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/).

I use:

  - [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) for layout.
  - [Page.js](https://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/) for layout.
  - And [tumblr](https://tumblr.com) for the blog portion

Basically it's [Polymer Starter Kit](https://polymerelements.github.io/polymer-starter-kit/) with tumblr's API (using JSONP). Polymer uses [Web Elements](http://webcomponents.org/) which are pretty dope. When browsers and servers support HTTP/2, the benefits of Web Components will get that much realer.

Finally, for hosting I use [surge](https://surge.sh/), which is great for hosting one page apps.
